# US-Senate-Elections
 I create a US Senate election database using data on election results, candidates, fundraising, and population from the FEC and US Census. Then I analyze the data and create models, including the neural network model described in Rumelhart, Hinton, &amp; Williams (1986), to predict election results. The file **Election Models and Results.ipynb** walks through my findings.

Programs:

1. create-election-dataset.py.
Creates the election-dataset.csv dataset for US Senate elections.

2. nnetwork.py.
Creates a neural network described in Rumelhart et al.

3. Election Models and Results.ipynb.
Jupyter notebook that analyzes US Senate election data and creates models to predict elections.



Data:

1. Election candidate data from the FEC.

2. Campaign fundraising data from the FEC.
